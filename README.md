# This Is My Sheep

A small three.js arcade game: you're the shepherd's dog, and wolves are coming for the flock.
Click the meadow to send the dog running; wolves that get too close to it turn tail.

## Run locally

ES modules need an HTTP server (opening `index.html` via `file://` won't work):

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000.

## Deploy

No build step. Push to `main`, then in the repo's **Settings → Pages** set the source to
**Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`**.

three.js is loaded from jsDelivr via the import map in `index.html`; all sounds are synthesized
with WebAudio, so there are no asset files.

## Code map

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `src/game.js` | State machine (menu → intro → playing → wave complete / game over), waves, main loop |
| `src/config.js` | Palette, tuning constants, per-wave difficulty |
| `src/entities.js` | Dog, Sheep, Wolf, Shepherd — primitive models + procedural animation |
| `src/flock.js` | Sheep steering: wander, separation, alignment, cohesion, fear |
| `src/wolves.js` | Wolf AI: WANDER → APPROACH → CHASE → ATTACK, FLEE, LEAVE |
| `src/juice.js` | Feedback for game events: rings, floating text, shake, flashes |
| `src/particles.js` | Single pooled `Points` particle system + presets |
| `src/audio.js` | Synthesized sound effects and ambience |
| `src/world.js` | Renderer, lights, camera rig, meadow, trees and decorations |
| `src/input.js` | Pointer → ground-plane raycast |
| `src/ui.js` | HUD, screens, off-screen wolf indicators |

`window.game` is exposed in the console for debugging.
